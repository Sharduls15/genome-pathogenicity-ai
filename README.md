# Genome Pathogenicity AI Predictor

An AI-powered application that analyzes raw genome sequences to predict pathogenicity scores and classify types of pathogenicity.

## Overview

This project implements machine learning models to:
- Accept raw genome sequence data as input
- Predict pathogenicity scores for genomic variants
- Classify types of pathogenicity (e.g., benign, likely benign, uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, pathogenic)
- Provide interpretable results for clinical and research applications

## Features

- **Sequence Processing**: Handles raw genome sequence data in various formats
- **ML-Powered Predictions**: Uses trained models to assess pathogenicity
- **Multi-class Classification**: Identifies specific types of pathogenicity
- **Scoring System**: Provides quantitative pathogenicity scores
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy model updates and improvements

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.pathogenicity_predictor import PathogenicityPredictor
from src.genome_analyzer import GenomeAnalyzer

# Initialize the predictor
predictor = PathogenicityPredictor()
analyzer = GenomeAnalyzer()

# Analyze a genome sequence
sequence = "ATCGATCGATCG..."  # Your raw genome sequence
features = analyzer.extract_features(sequence)
pathogenicity_score, pathogenicity_type = predictor.predict(features)

print(f"Pathogenicity Score: {pathogenicity_score}")
print(f"Pathogenicity Type: {pathogenicity_type}")
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
python src/main.py --sequence "ATCGATCGATCG..." --format fasta
```

## Models

The application uses ensemble methods combining:
- Deep learning models for sequence pattern recognition
- Traditional ML classifiers for feature-based prediction
- Domain-specific genomic knowledge integration

## Data Requirements

- **Input**: Raw genome sequences in FASTA, FASTQ, or plain text format
- **Training Data**: Annotated genomic variants with known pathogenicity classifications
- **Features**: Sequence-based, structural, and functional genomic features
