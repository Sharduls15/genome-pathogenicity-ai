## 🧬 Understanding the Results

### Pathogenicity Score (0.0 - 1.0)
- **0.00 - 0.20:** Benign (non-pathogenic)
- **0.20 - 0.40:** Likely Benign
- **0.40 - 0.60:** Uncertain Significance
- **0.60 - 0.80:** Likely Pathogenic
- **0.80 - 1.00:** Pathogenic (disease-causing)

### Confidence Score (0.0 - 1.0)
- **> 0.80:** High confidence prediction
- **0.60 - 0.80:** Moderate confidence
- **< 0.60:** Low confidence (uncertain)

### Feature Importance
The model shows which genomic features contributed most to the prediction:
- **entropy:** Information content of the sequence

## 🎯 Example Predictions

```bash
# Test with different sequence types
python src/main.py --sequence "ATGCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATC" --model TRAINED-PATHO
# Result: uncertain_significance (score: 0.475)

python src/main.py --sequence "ATGAAACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC" --model TRAINED-PATHO  
# Result: benign (score: 0.449) - Low complexity sequence

python src/main.py --sequence "ATGCGATCGATCGATCTAATAATAATAATAG" --model TRAINED-PATHO
# Result: uncertain_significance (score: 0.511) - Contains stop codons
```
